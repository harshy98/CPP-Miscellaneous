# CPP-Miscellaneous
Collection of Miscellaneous C++ Programs coded by me
List of Programs:
1>Find 10001st prime number
2>Determine if two strings are anagrams using std::unordered_map
3>Count number of subarray elements defined between some range which are evenly divisible by some large number K 
4>Check if two line segments intersect
5>Determine maximum product of 2 elements in an array
6>Get minimum cost of graph by either building roads or libraries to connect all nodes to at least one library
7>Min swaps to set each element of an unsorted array in a position equal to its (value+1)
8>Calculate minimum number of bribes that took place to get the queue into its current state where ideally the value of people should dictate their positions and person from back can bribe at most 2 people in front.
9>Deque operations i.e. insert,delete from back and front.
10>Determine if a rat stuck in a maze can reach its destination from a designated source using backtracking and recursion.
11>To prove that in f(x)=1+1/x when x=-0.618, f(x) is always a different final value, otherwise f(x) = 1.61803.
12>Build, update and query elements in a segment tree.
13>Count special substrings in a given string where special string is one which has all characters same or one in which the middle character is different and all else characters are same. For example: aabaa,aaa.
14>Determine if a given sum is possible from an input array of elements.
15>Calculating the superdigit of a large number represented as a string repeated k times. 
    We define super digit of an integer  using the following rules:
    Given an integer, we need to find the super digit of the integer.
    ->If x has only 1 digit, then its super digit is x.
    ->Otherwise, the super digit of x is equal to the super digit of the sum of the digits of x.
16>Swap subtrees at levels k,2k,3k,.... in a binary tree.
